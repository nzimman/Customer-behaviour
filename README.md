# Simulate customer behaviour

## Synopsis
The goal of this project is to simulate the customer behaviour in a supermarket.

## Data
The analysis and calculation of the transition probabilities (probability of switiching from section A to B) are based on the data in the *customer_data* folder. 

### Data Exploration
*to be added*

### Transition Probabilites
These are calculated in the file *transition_prob_git.py*. There are some fields that need to be filled: path to the customer data and credentials of the PostGreSQL database where the data is saved.
